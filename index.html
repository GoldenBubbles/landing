             <h1>The telework</h1>

             <p id="mid">What is telework, how did it arise, is it applied, and is it perceived?</p>
         </div>

         <h2>Definition, history and context</h2>

         <div class="banner2">
             <p>According to article L.1222-9 of the Labor Code, teleworking means any form of work organization in which work which could also have been performed on the employer's premises is carried out by an employee outside of these premises on a voluntary basis using information and communication technologies.</p>

             <p>The first signs of teleworking appeared in 1950 when Norbert Wiener, then architect supervising from Europe the construction of a building in the United States. It was in 2002 that an agreement was reached at European level which strengthens the rights and security of this new world of work.</p>

             <p>Teleworking takes place in different contexts. It falls within the framework of technology, ecology, transport of social and politics.</p>
         </div>

         <h2>Working process</h2>

         <div class="banner3">
             <p>If "teleworking" has become commonplace, the legal definition of teleworking limits its access to employees only. In addition, the profession exercised must lend itself to it: autonomy and use of new technologies must reflect your daily life at the office ... Using telework does not necessarily mean working all the time outside the company: work can thus be done at both in telework and in the employer's premises, which is moreover recommended. The teleworker has no special status, it is only a way of organizing work. It is a work organization that mainly targets service companies. We cannot, for example, offer telework to a baker or a worker. The employer does not have the possibility of imposing telework on an employee (except in cases of force majeure), he can simply offer him. However, this is a criterion that can be retained for the hiring of an employee. As for the employee, he can ask to telework to his employer, who accepts or not. Employees working in telework have the same rights and obligations as other employees. The provisions laid down by law for employers also apply in the event of the use of telework: occupational health, safety rule, access to training, etc.</p>
         </div>

         <h2>Positif aspects and limits</h2>

         <div class="banner4">
             <p>In terms of benefits, it is true that teleworking seems to be idyllic, and that several elements are very interesting, whether for managers or employees.</p>
             <p>But if we can paint a golden portrait of telework, nothing is ever perfect, and some drawbacks (or points of vigilance at least) are to be taken into consideration.</p>

             <h5>To conclude, today teleworking is implemented in companies by allowing employees to work from home. This use is a start, but has its limits. With the spread of Third Place and other coworking spaces, a new approach breaking the isolation of the teleworker or the employee in the home office is beginning to appear throughout the territory.</h5>
